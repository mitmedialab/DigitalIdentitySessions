# Brainstorm Session (end of day)

* Could there be a magna carta / constitutional type system of checks and balances?
  - Could a direct democracy network be an option to allow more choice of systems including a strong hierarchical leader?
  - What is there were a network that enabled groups to adopt rules reflecting their priorities in a more adaptive manner?
  - The protocols are relevant - there may be different protocols at different layers of the stack of a network and even that apply to different components or networks within the network but there needs to be some common protocol aspect.  

*  Proof of Luck: What if there were a “proof of luck” protocol (not proof of work, proof of control, etc) See: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05435  and https://github.com/luckychain/lucky 

* Key question: imagine all the scenarios and situations that respect individual “ownership/control” of identity at a deep layer that is fundamental to identity:
  - Also look at more superficial layer like: credit history, legal records access, FIPA, Fair Credit Reporting Act, HIPAA, FERPA, Telecom, etc, etc)
  - Also - look at what is “security” and how does it relate to basic rights to be secure in our person and papers.  Right to consent to be governed.  

* A system that enables individual to securely “Opt-Out” like the do-not-call-list.  
  - Today credentials are managed at national or sub-national levels - can we have a concept of an individual identity credential that is trans-national? 
  -  How about an application that is a key-service (providing easy way to generate a key pair and attach other core identifiers like hashed biometrics so you can prove it is yours?
  - Define what the blockchain prototocl and global identifier system is and governance of the system is - how it works.  
  - This can enable the "ClearButton" aka "OpenNotice" use case envisioned by Human Dynamics group for a "New Deal on Data"
