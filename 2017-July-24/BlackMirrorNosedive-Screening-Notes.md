# Black Mirror Screening Notes

**Black Mirror Excerpt Screening: Nosedive (Episode 1; Season 3)**


* There is one unified identity/reputation system at play in this scenarior
* In this scenario how do we avoid a race to the bottom (becoming the "worst" fake version of you)
* If this was not the sole judge of the character it would allow for much more authentic interaction
* At Casino's (private property) we have this type of ID now and people can get benefits, etc based on their profile.  In the wider public word, is there a right to "not" be recognized?
* This is an open question in the US but in the EU there is an adjacent right to "be forgotten" for reputation damaging data
* In this scenario there is a digital and physical identity connected but we are not connecting emotional identity.  What if LinkedIn and other identity systems are also connected?
* What happens when the "all disclosure all the time" principle of social network expectations is applied to broader and deeper systems of identity.  The Social Network model may not apply smoothly.
* Social identity need not be the basis but it is increasingly becoming a foundation for population-wide systems (example in China)
* It is unclear who is behind this system in Nosedive - it is private and also seems to operate at the airport and elsewhere.  
* The constant updates of personal activity and behavior and communications with social media culture is all-consuming and may be a harbinger.  The question is: what are the choices we have?  Outlining the choices would be an important basis to understand/decide how to move forward
* We saw a vision of the future where the biometric auth is no longer an option.  There is a bright line on digital identity systems when it comes to services or activities that people have a right to do.  
* There is a scene we did not show with a truck driver who is effectively a social outcast (she has like a rating of 2 or 1 point something) and the implications are profound.  WATH IT	
* Firstly - the scenario combines identification and reputation.  Maybe they should be separate things. Would the behavior change if the system were "opt in"?  What if you could not see the reputation of some people but you could see the rating of others?
* Evidently the main character chose to opt in initially and even liked it a lot.
* This raises question of how to pose meaningful and informed choice for opt in?
* This is related to getting informed consent for computational social science studies with personal data
* If/when social or other digital identity networks become so prevalent that not opting in mean not participating fully in society or the economy then do we risk not providing real "choice" "opt-in"
* There is a key need for Literacy and understanding.  There is an economic perspective underlying the Nosedive episode that is important.
* In fact, some aspects of the espisode had a kind of neo-digital-colonial connotation... was this showing a kind of preying on more vulnurable populations?
* Neil Stephenson shows a way forward in a more tribal based society.  
* What if we had a rule against discriminating against people who do not choose to "opt in" to digital identity systems in general or to any particular system.
* It is critical that we look at the protocol layer as the layer at which some of these issues are addressed and blockchain in particular as a source of capabilities at lower and higher levels of a stack.  We should look at identity more like as a "utility" to enable exciting outcomes.
* Who decides protocol rules?  
* Everybody involved should have a say and the protocols should enable a wide latitude of choices.
* Major agreement with prior point
* Should governments be involved?
* Perhaps government MUST be involved.  
* And it depends on the "use case" because in some contexts like voting gov is needed but other contexts gov is not required.
* What if I chose a protocol based system that works for me and yet my data is entered into a different protocol based system?  EG the facebook face recognition litigation in state of Ill.  Is gov't needed to enforce norms here?
* Attention needs to be paid to GDRP in the EU.  
* What if we treated personal data that is identity data as personal property?  
* What rules apply when a party gets personal data from a third party but not from the person directly?  What rules apply?
* In china for example, there is wide scale use of cashless systems and face recognition with population-wide identioty.  This is going a definite direction.  In a lot of ways China is a potential place for the extreme case of digital identity hierarchical/totalitarian scenario to emerge. 
* Re a legal framework - it may be true that data is my property but it is also different.  It may be more like my body (it is me, not just mine).  
* Try applying personal property rules in light of FIPS right to know who has your data and to get a copy of it
* The big question is who is the enforcing body for national and international legal norms?  
* A strong federal gov willing to enforce it is key. There is also an evidentiary question to knwo who has the data.  
* Is there a supply chain approach for personal data that requires the data can only be copied or changed by certain keys, for example?  
* Maybe blockchain can be part fo a solution and can be as important or more important than government action based on structure of the hard-core tech
* In travel, people do a lot for their loyalty points and status.  What if the motivation for percs - given it is such a driver - this is going to be a big aspect of the landscape of the future.
* Could this be leveraged in a positive way as part of designing incentives and disincentives well?  
* Could be dangerous because Nosedive tried to align incentivized to behave well and it went very wrong.
* Re incentives - looking at blockchain for social good, if we re-aligned motives from mining math for money to rewards for confirming / vouching for friends/family?  
* This could be a great application but on what blockchain would this happen and who would make the rules governing that system?  Today there is no blockchain that could do that.  We are really at step one now.  The point is that we need to create some good options like this now.  This will enable a turning point to get to a place where we can do the things we want to do.
